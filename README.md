# Nutscript-Atomic
Hi thanks for using the Atomic schema for Nutscript.
This is post apocalyptic schema for Nutscript 1.1 beta.
This schema is quite basic, you should REALLY add something to it if you want a real post apocalyptic system.

You can find the addons used in this schema with some maps that could fit it here:
